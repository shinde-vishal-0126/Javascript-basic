<!-- Q what is differences between the DeBouncing and throttling 
 * debouncing and throttling are techniques used to control the frequency of function or optimize event execution.
Debouncing : 
* Wait for the certain time before invoking the function again 
 * The purpose of debouncing is to delay the execution of a function until a pause in event occurrences
 It ensures that the function is only executed once after a series of rapid events.
* Debouncing is often used for scenarios like handling user input or scroll events, where you want to wait for a pause in input before triggering a function to avoid rapid, unintended executions.
: Debouncing is typically implemented by using a timer. 
When an event occurs, a timer is started. If another event occurs before the timer elapses, the timer is reset
The function is executed only when the timer finally expires, indicating a pause in event occurrences.
 Debouncing is concerned with ensuring that the function is only executed once, and it waits for a pause in event occurrences. It's about delaying execution until the events have stopped for a certain duration

Throttling : 
* Limit the number of time the function can be called over the certain period 
* Ensure that the function is called only once if the event is triggered multiple time
*  Throttling is used to limit the rate at which a function can be executed. It ensures that a function is called at a maximum frequency, regardless of how often the event occurs
Throttling is commonly used for scenarios like rate-limiting API requests or preventing resource-intensive operations from overloading a system.
Throttling can be implemented by allowing the function to execute at a fixed interval or rate
For example, you may execute the function every 100 milliseconds. Any excess calls that occur within that interval are ignored until the next interval begins.
 Throttling focuses on limiting the rate at which a function is executed. It guarantees that the function is executed at a controlled pace and doesn't exceed a certain rate, regardless of how frequently the events occur
