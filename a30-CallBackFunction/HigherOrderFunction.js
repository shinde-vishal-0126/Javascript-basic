//? Higher order function 

// A higher order function is a function that take one or more function as an arguments or return a function as result
// Def: function which takes another function as an argument is called as HOF (Higher order function )
// In javascript higher order function is super flexible function 

//* It can do two special things so higher order function that either:
// 1. Accept the another function as an argument 
// So just like regular function number or string take as input or as an parameter or argument so just like higher order function take another function as an argument  
// Think of it like a function that can invite another function to party.

// 2 .Return function 
// Higher order function also give you back new function 
// or higher order function it return result as new or another function

//So most real like example of the higher order function 
//! map, filter, and reduce are higher-order functions that take callback functions to process arrays.


//example in map higher order function
const number = [1,2,3,4,5]
function double(x){
    return x * 2
}
const doubleNumbers = number.map(double);
console.log(doubleNumbers);

// ex with filter function
function isEven(x){
    return x %2 === 0
}
const eveNum = number.filter(isEven);
console.log(eveNum);

// So higher order function as function that can work with another function either by taking them as input or create the new function as output 
// They make your code more flexible and powerful by allowing you function to bundling a block to solved different kind of problem  
// Higher order function commonly used in javascript task such as array manipulation e.g map , filter, event Handling  , and asynchronous programming function  like setTimeout and  promise;
// Using higher order function you wire more maintainable and modular code  and prompt the separation of concern and reside te code block to perform specific task 



//? What is the difference between Higher Order function and callback function ?
//! callback function 
//  A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function to be called back at a later time.

//! Higher order function 
// the higher order function is function where which takes another function as an argument is called as HOF or return function as result 

// example
function createAdder(x){
    // here createAdder is higher order function it return function as result 
    return function(y){
        return x*y
    }
} 
const data = createAdder(5);
const result = data(5);
console.log('result', result)

//? Why Use Higher-Order Functions?
// Code Reusability: Encapsulate reusable logic in functions.
// Abstraction: Makes code cleaner and more expressive.
// Functional Composition: Combine small functions to build more complex behavior.
// Callbacks and Promises: Essential for asynchronous programming (e.g., setTimeout, then in Promises).
// Modularity and Composability
// They help in breaking down complex logic into smaller, reusable pieces. By using higher-order functions, you can compose simpler functions into more complex ones, which promotes clean and modular code.
// Avoiding Code Duplication
// Since higher-order functions allow you to pass different behavior as arguments, you can avoid repeating similar code. For example, instead of writing a custom loop each time, you can use higher-order functions like map, filter, or reduce to handle collections in a consistent and declarative manner.
// Improved Readability
// Using higher-order functions can improve the readability of the code by expressing operations in terms of the functions that they execute. This is especially true when used with well-named functions (e.g., filter, map, compose).
