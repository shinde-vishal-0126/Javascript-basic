//how to export variables, function , and class , from a module and resume them into another model.
//In Es6 module file executed in strict mode only, (means that any variable or function declared in the module won’t be added automatically to the global scope)

//! You can not export an anonymous function of the class using this syntax.

// export statement exposes the message variable to other modules.
export let message = "Hi, vishal";

// you have to export variable, function , class so you place the export keyword in front of its
export function getMessage(){
return message
}

export function setMessage(message){
    message = msg
}

export class parson {
    constructor(){
        super()
    }
}

//! also you have to defined the function first then later you can export it 

function foo(){
    return "Hello"
}
function bar(){
    return "buy"
}
export {foo}; // here you have to export foo function in another module but not bar because it is not defined as export (so it is private function)
