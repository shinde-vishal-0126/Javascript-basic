 // 1, Bitwise operator 
// A bitwise operator treats their operands a set of 32 bits rather than as decimal, hexadecimal or  octal numbers
// 2. Bitwise operators perform their operation on such binary representation but they return standard javascript numerical value.
// 3. So bitwise operators perform bit by bit operation of numbers.


// Type:
// Bitwise Operator
// 1. bitwise AND (&) (a & b) --> 
// return one in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of each operands once

// 2. bitwise OR (|) (a|b) --> 
// return a zero in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of both operands zero

// 3. bitwise XOR (a ^ b) --> 
// return zero in each bit position for which the corresponding return a one in each bit position for which the corresponding bits are different

// 4. bitwise NOt (~) --> 
// invert the bit or its operands 

// 5. bitwise LEFT SHIFT (a << b) →
//  shift a  in binary representation b bits to the left shifting in zero from the right 

// 6. bitwise  RIGHT SHIFT (a >> b) →
//  shift a binary representation b bits to the right discarding bits shifted off

// 7. bitwise ZERO-FILL (RIGHT-SHIFT) →
//  shift a in binary representation b bits to the right discarding bits shifted off and shifted is zero form the left
